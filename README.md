# 🌫️ Comprehensive Research Report: Air Quality Index (AQI) of Chandigarh 📊

Welcome to the repository hosting the full research report, supporting data, and presentation on Chandigarh’s Air Quality Index as of November 2025.

## 📚 About This Project

This project provides an in-depth quantitative and qualitative study of Chandigarh’s air quality. It analyzes real-time data, historical trends, and key pollution sources including:

🚗 Vehicular emissions (highest vehicle density in India)  
🌫️ Road dust pollution  
🔥 Seasonal stubble burning in neighboring Punjab and Haryana  
🚧 Construction and waste burning impacts  
🌡️ Meteorological factors such as temperature inversion

Despite government efforts and ₹31+ crore spent under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), data shows little improvement. This report offers policy recommendations and practical solutions for sustainable air quality management.
